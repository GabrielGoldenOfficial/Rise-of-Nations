Stalin was then executed by firing squad on live radio."

 soviet.70.t:0"The Soviet Union Demands that we Return Land to China"
 soviet.70.d:0"The Soviets have demanded that we cede Mengkukuo, Manchukuo, and occupied Hebei to the People's Republic of China, else they will declare war on us. In return, they claim that they will give us North Sakhalin. This is a very poor trade, but we can ill-afford a war with the Soviets. What shall we do?" 
 soviet.70.a:0"We will comply with their unreasonable demands."

 soviet.71.t:0"Japanese Immediately cede Chinese lands"
 soviet.71.d:0"The Japanese have chosen to comply with our demands. Troops from the People's Republic of China have already established control over Manchuria and Beijing. It is now up to us to deliver on our part of the deal." 
 soviet.71.a:0"Very well."
 
 soviet.72.t:0"The Japanese Refuse Us"
 soviet.72.d:0"The Japanese have rejected our proposal and expelled our diplomats. That they would dare to do such a thing is inconcievable. Trotsky must declare war on them as he promised, else lose all credibility. Luckily for us, our diligent general staff already has an operation in progress to punish the Japanese for their insolence." 
 soviet.72.a:0"We have prepared for this."
 
 soviet.73.t:0"Soviet Troops Seize Hokkaido"
 soviet.73.d:0"The Japanese high command was shocked today to hear that Soviet Paratroopers are landing in the region of Hokkaido, eliminating our garrisons there and securing the entire region for the Soviet Union.

 soviet.74.t:0"Japan Wishes to Barter"
 soviet.74.d:0"The Japanese have informed us that they are open to ceding land back to the Chinese people, but that we must offer them something better. That we must barter with the Japanese like meiserly capitalist pigs is extremely insulting. How shall we react?"

 soviet.75.a:0"Hostilities commense."
 
 soviet.76.t:0"The Soviets Offer us Dockyards"
 soviet.76.d:0"In response to our request, the Soviet Union has proposed to send us dockyard equipment so that we can construct new drydocks, disassembling their own drydock machinery in the process. It seems that they want to give us industry that we cannot use to make weapons against them. Is this deal satisfactory to us?" 
 soviet.76.a:0"It is satisfactory."
 soviet.76.b:0"Ask for industrial goods instead."
 
 soviet.77.t:0"Japan Accepts Dockyards"
 soviet.77.d:0"The Japanese have accepted our proposal to disassemble our dockyard machinery to ship to Japan in exchange for Chinese land. While this is more than we had originally intended to give up, we have completed our objective and this must be counted as a win for Trotsky and the Soviet people as a whole." 
 soviet.77.a:0"A Fair Deal."
 
 soviet.78.t:0"The Japanese Request Industrial Goods"
 soviet.78.d:0"The Japanese have rejected our offer of naval dockyards and have instead proposed that we give them industrial goods instead. The Japanese claim that they understand our reluctance to provide anything that can be used against us in the future, but that these industrial goods will be used for civilian consumption." 
 soviet.78.a:0"Very well, we accept the deal."
 soviet.78.b:0"We think not, the Japanese are lying."
 
 soviet.79.t:0"The Soviets Accept our Proposal"
 soviet.79.d:0"The Soviets have agreed to give us civilian industry, at economic cost to themselves. It wasn't too bad of a deal in the end, we should be able to use this newly acquired industry to reinvigorate our own domestic arms industry." 
 soviet.79.a:0"The best possible outcome."
 
 soviet.80.t:0"Talks Break Down"
 soviet.80.d:0"Not only have the Soviets rejected our proposal, but they seem to have lost interest in the affair altogether. We have just learned that the Soviet delegation has departed and our foreign ministry doubts that we will hear from them anytime soon." 
 soviet.80.a:0"What a relief."
 
 soviet.81.t:0"Beginning of the Lend-Lease Programme"
 soviet.81.d:0"American aid will be invaluable to us. They will help specialize and supplement our production, and where our production is lacking. Unfortunately it will be some months before the first major shipment gets here." 
 soviet.81.a:0"We will have to wait."
 
 soviet.82.t:0"First Delivery"
 soviet.82.d:0"The first allied lend-lease shipment has arrived. The sheer number of vehicles, jeeps, and various equipment is staggering. The British, surprisingly, have sent us a significant amount of aid also. The trucks we have received are doubly useful for moving supplies, but also towing our old artillery which have been sitting in our reserves." 
 soviet.82.a:0"About time."
 
 soviet.83.t:0"Second Delivery"
 soviet.83.d:0"This second allied shipment has managed to surpass the last one in terms of equipment sent. The American trucks are very reliable and robust - an excellent platform for our new rocket artillery platforms. We will turn the American Studebakers into Katusha rocket launchers and strike fear very deep into the german lines." 
 soviet.83.a:0"Excellent."
 
 soviet.84.t:0"Third Delivery"
 soviet.84.d:0"We have received a greatly increased amount of tanks and armored vehicles as well as aircraft, in comparison with the last major shipment." 
 soviet.84.a:0"Right on time."
 
 soviet.85.t:0"Fourth Delivery"
 soviet.85.d:0"Our western allies continue to supplement our production. While this arrangement will be coming to an end very soon, it undoubtedly provided significant assistance to us in our fight against fascism." 
 soviet.85.a:0"Keep it up."
 
 soviet.86.t:0"Final Delivery"
 soviet.86.d:0"Today we have received our last major lend-lease shipment from the western democracies. Unfortunately they tell us that they can help us no longer. On the bright side, what most of the equipment we currently have in service will eventually wear down and be scrapped before the end of the war, erasing our debt to the Americans under the terms of lend-lease."
 soviet.86.a:0"Too bad."
 
 soviet.87.t:0"The Fall of Moscow"
 soviet.87.d:0"Unfortunately we have lost Moscow. We have prepared for this eventuality and have moved our capital to Kuybyshev, which will hopefully be out of the range of the current enemy offense." 
 soviet.87.a:0"We must relocate our capital!"
 
 soviet.88.t:0"Moscow Recaptured"

 soviet.88.a:0"We can move our capital back now."
 
 soviet.89.t:0"The Great Patriotic War"
 soviet.89.d:0"German treachery will not go unanswered. The Motherland has assembled fresh manpower reserves to send to the fight. The Nazis cannot win in the face of such overwhelming oppositions. Our men will all fight and die as heroes until the Nazi scum have no more fodder to send to our butchery." 
 soviet.89.a:0"We will fight until the last drop of blood."
 
 soviet.90.t:0"Continuation of the Great Patriotic War"
 soviet.90.d:0"The memory of the German betrayal will stay with us always. We will never forget those who perished because of tolerance for fascism that existed throughout the world at one time."

 soviet.91.t:0"The Soviet Union Tests Detonation of a Plutonium Bomb"

RON_Russian_Alt_History.70.t:0"The Military Government"
RON_Russian_Alt_History.70.d:0"A military dictatorship is a dictatorship in which the military exerts complete or substantial control over political authority, and the dictator is often a high-ranked military officer. A military junta is a government led by a committee of military leaders. The term junta means 'meeting' or 'committee' and originated in the national and local junta organized by the Spanish resistance to Napoleon's invasion of Spain in 1808. The term is now used to refer to an authoritarian form of government characterized by oligarchic military dictatorship, as distinguished from other categories of authoritarian rule, specifically strongman (autocratic military dictatorships); machine (oligarchic party dictatorships); and bossism (autocratic party dictatorships). A junta often comes to power as a result of a coup d'état. The junta may either formally take power as the nation's governing body, with the power to rule by decree, or may wield power by exercising binding (but informal) control over a nominally civilian government. These two forms of junta rule are sometimes called open rule and disguised rule. Disguised rule may take the form of either civilianization or indirect rule. Civilianization occurs when a junta publicly ends its obviously military features, but continues its dominance. For example, the junta may terminate martial law, forgo military uniforms in favor of civilian attire, 'colonize' government with former military officers, and make use of political parties or mass organizations. 'Indirect rule' involves the junta's exertion of concealed, behind-the-scenes control over a civilian puppet. Indirect rule by the military can include either broad control over the government or control over a narrower set of policy areas, such as military or national security matters. Who will lead the Military Government?"

RON_Russian_Alt_History.71.d:0"The Russian Fascist Party (RFP), sometimes called the All-Russian Fascist Party, was a minor Russian émigré movement that was based in Manchukuo during the 1930s and 1940s. The defeat of the White Armies in the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922, which discredited the older White leaders, together with the rise of the Fascism in Italy caused many younger Russian emigres to look to fascism as an alternative that might best Communism. The fascist movement among the White émigrés existed around the world, but the majority of its supporters lived in Manchuria and in the United States. A number of Russians had settled in Manchuria when the Russian Empire had occupied the region from 1900 to 1905, and numbers increased from an influx fleeing after the Red Army victory in the Russian Civil War. A secret convention of the various groups took place, leading to the foundation of the RFP under the presidency of Major General Vladimir Dmitrievich Kozmin. Konstantin Rodzaevsky became Secretary General of the party's central committee on May 26, 1931, becoming the de facto leader of the party. Adopting the slogan"God, Nation, Labour" and publishing the journal Natsiya ("Nation"), the party called for Italian-style fascism to take advantage of the shaky position of the Bolshevik leaders in the face of both external and internal opposition."

It was based in Putnam, Connecticut, United States and was founded on May 10, 1933. In 1934, in Yokohama, the Russian Fascist Party (RFP) and VFO attempted to merge into a new entity, the All-Russia Fascist Party. On April 3, 1934, representatives from both organisations signed a protocol number 1, which proclaimed the merger of RFP and VFO and the creation of the All-Russia Fascist Party (VFP). The new organisation was intended to connect the RFP's organizational structure with the financial resources of the VFO.
