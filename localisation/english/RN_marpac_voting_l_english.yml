MARPAC_resolution_51:0 "§RResolution 51§!: Authorization of Signing the Paris Peace Treaties\n\nProposed: §G[FRA.GetName]§!\n\nSince the end of the §YSecond World War§!, a number of conflicts and unresolved issues have persisted in Europe. Following the §YPlan for European Stability§! in 1947, efforts were made to establish lasting peace and stability in the region. Under the leadership of the French Republic, the §YPeace Negotiation Commission§! has worked tirelessly to bring all parties to the table. With the conclusion of negotiations, §G[FRA.GetName]§Y proposes to the §YEuropean Council§Y the official signing of the Paris Peace Treaties to formally end hostilities and lay the groundwork for a peaceful and cooperative future in Europe."
MARPAC_resolution_1:0 "§RResolution 1§!: Authorization of Military Intervention in the Boxer Rebellion\n\nProposed: §G[FRA.GetName]§!\n\nSince the outbreak of the §YBoxer Rebellion§! in China, anti-foreign and anti-Christian sentiments have led to widespread violence and chaos. Foreign nationals and Chinese Christians are in grave danger. Following the §YInternational Coalition Agreement§! in 1900, the united military forces of the participating nations have agreed to intervene. Under the pretext of protecting lives and restoring order, we have allowed a period of negotiation for a peaceful resolution. However, the Boxer forces have continued their hostilities and defied our demands. The §G[FRA.GetName]§Y proposes to the §YEuropean nations§Y to authorize a coordinated military intervention to protect foreign nationals, restore peace, and uphold international interests."
MARPAC_resolution_10:0 "§RResolution 10§!: Ceasefire Agreement in the Great War\n\nProposed: §G[FRA.GetName]§!\n\nAfter years of devastating conflict in the §YGreat War§!, it has become clear that no decisive victory can be achieved by any of the warring parties. The prolonged fighting has led to enormous loss of life, economic ruin, and widespread suffering. In light of these circumstances, a ceasefire has been proposed to bring an end to hostilities and establish a new order in Europe. As part of this ceasefire agreement, the following territorial adjustments have been agreed upon: Germany will annex Luxembourg, while Austria-Hungary will cede the state of Trentino but gain the state of Friuli Venezia Giulia. Poland will be released as an independent nation. Romania will acquire all of Bessarabia. France will regain Alsace-Lorraine, restoring its historical borders.This resolution aims to create a more stable and balanced Europe, reducing the likelihood of future conflicts and allowing for the reconstruction and healing of war-torn nations. The §G[FRA.GetName]§Y proposes to the §YEuropean nations§Y the formal acceptance and implementation of this ceasefire agreement."
