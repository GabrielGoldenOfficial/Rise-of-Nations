In this regard, the Nationalist government proposes that all warlords within China align themselves with the Nationalists. If accepted, the warlords will become puppets of Nationalist China and lose their autonomy. Denial of this proposal will be seen as an act of war. This is a crucial step towards the unification and stabilization of China in the post-war era. Therefore, it is proposed that all Chinese warlords decide whether to side with the Nationalists and become part of a unified China. The §G[CHI.GetName]§Y proposes to all Chinese warlords to align with the Nationalist government and support the unified Chinese state, or face the consequences of being seen as enemies of the nation."
