**Describe the bug**
Technically, as there are a lot of new territories, almost the whole Old Claims branch of Hungary needed to be fixed, only working Slovakia part of it.
I checked every single province of the territories of the touched nations, and a ton of provinces need to be asking so right about the focus that needs to be held by the countries of Yugoslavia, Romania, and Italy. Ultimately, I gave up writing down all province IDs, so I wrote down the needed province IDs only.

I do not make any screenshot
